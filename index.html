                      <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
                      <p>I have a passion for music and love to inform people of up-and-coming artists on my website: <a href="http://mustknowbands.com">mustknowbands.com</a>. I love going to the movies, concerts, and sporting events. I am obsessed with watching football, hockey, and basketball. I like to play the electric guitar in my spare time.</p>

                      <p>My dream job is to develop websites, apps, or games that will positively affect people's lives for years to come. I am a problem solver and my logical thinking helps me overcome any obstacles.  I love to think creatively and share my ideas with others, as working in groups is always something that excites me.</p>

                      <h2>What Have I Been Listening To?</h2>
                      <p>I have been listening to the new Alt-J album called "This is All Yours". They are an Indie band from England who I have seen in concert twice. They have a very soothing, unique sound that instantly becomes addicting to listen to.</p>
